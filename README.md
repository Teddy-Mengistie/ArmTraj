# ArmTraj

### What does it do?
This program is made specifically for two jointed arms and it helps with achieving smooth motion.  
It creates a smooth interpolation for the positions and uses Trajectory parametrization to calculate velocity.  
The velocities are calculated with taking into account specified constraints for the max velocities and acceleration.  
It also takes into account, the curvature of the path to limit the velocity.  
The constraints apecified are the max velocities and accelerations for each joint separately.




## Getting Started

1. Download Processing <a href = "https://processing.org/">here</a>.
2. Install the library ControlP5 which is used for the UI. (Sketch -> Import Library -> Manage Libraries) <img src ="https://github.com/Teddy-Mengistie/ArmTraj/assets/55628361/dfc6381b-ad84-4817-8e27-68d25759642c" height = 350 width = 300>
3. Search for "ControlP5" and click on download
4. Copy over the code from the "Arm_Visual.pde" file on this repository into your processing program.
5. Press Run
